## Summary

In this lab, you accessed the Azure OpenAI Playground, uploaded your own dataset, and integrated it with the chat experience. You then interacted with the Azure OpenAI ChatGPT model to generate responses grounded in your uploaded data.

## You have successfully completed the Hands-on lab.

### Conclusion

By completing this lab, you gained hands-on experience with Azure Microsoft Foundry to extend ChatGPT with your own data. You configured the system to respond to domain-specific queries, deployed the model as a web application, and validated that all interactions were successfully logged in Cosmos DB. This exercise demonstrated how to build, deploy, and monitor a customized AI-powered solution end-to-end.
